description: "Intuition is a browser extension for saving content to Notion. Its goal is to allow users to save web URLs and webpage content to Notion pages and databases. I started building this since the ones that already exist are limited by functionality or design. Intuition tries to match the UX of Notion to feel more intuitive."
